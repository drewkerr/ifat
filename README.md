# Immediate Feedback Assessment Tool (IF-AT)

Immediate feedback assessment is a key element of Team-Based Learning (TBL) as in the work of Michaelsen & Sweet (2008).

TBL has two phases:
1. Readiness assurance process (RAP)
   - Individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) where students take a (differentiated) multiple choice test on the topic to be studied, which is then marked by their teacher;
   - Team readiness assurance test (tRAT) where teams of students retake the same test, reaching consensus on their choices and receiving immediate feedback e.g. through 'scratchy' cards;
2. Application exercises, where all teams work on the same, signicant problems before simultaneously reporting their specific choice.

The use of IF-AT is key to the tRAT. This tool provides a digital alternative to the use of the scratchy paper IF-AT cards which can be hard to source.

## Goals of IF-AT

- Provide immediate feedback to teams of students in multiple choice tests. Existing digital tools either focus on individual students or delayed feedback.
- Design that minimises distraction from team discussion (e.g. stimulus, questions printed and working out done on paper rather than on shared device).

## Features

- Custom test length (and choices) generated from alphabetic answer key
- Multiple sessions with start/finish times and unique session keys
- Email teacher with CSV of team names, results, start time and score calculation
